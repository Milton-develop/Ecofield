# 🌿 EcoField Logger & Stats Suite

A complete field data management system designed for ecological fieldwork. This suite consists of two integrated applications: a **Data Logging Platform** for students to record observations and a **Statistical Dashboard** for real-time biodiversity analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. EcoField Logger (Flask App)
*   **Secure Logging:** Group-based login system for organized data collection.
*   **Field Data Entry:** Records Species, Count, Habitat, Location, GPS, and Field Notes.
*   **Data Validation:** Ensures required fields (like Group ID and Species Name) are correct.
*   **Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Create and manage student groups.
    *   Archive datasets at the end of the season.
    *   Download master CSV files.
*   **Export:** Students can download their specific group's data as CSV.

### 2. Eco-Stats Dashboard (Streamlit App)
*   **Visual Analysis:** Reads the logged CSV data to generate instant charts.
*   **Biodiversity Metrics:** Automatically calculates **Simpson’s Index of Diversity**.
*   **Habitat Comparison:** Side-by-side bar charts comparing Forest vs. Grassland vs. Rocky areas.
*   **Species Richness:** Visualizes abundance and distribution via interactive Plotly charts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python (Flask)
*   **Analysis Engine:** Python (Pandas, Plotly)
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Streamlit
*   **Data Storage:** CSV (Flat-file database for portability)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecofield-logger.git
cd ecofield-logger
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the System

Since this system has two parts (The Logger and The Dashboard), you need to run them in **separate terminals** to use them simultaneously locally.

### Terminal 1: Start the Logger (Flask)
This runs the website where students submit data.
```bash
python app.py
```
*   **Access at:** `http://localhost:5002` (or 5000)

### Terminal 2: Start the Dashboard (Streamlit)
This runs the visualization tool.
```bash
python -m streamlit run eco_stats.py
```
*   **Access at:** `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧪 How to Use

### For Students (Field Work)
1.  Open the **Logger App** (`app.py`).
2.  Enter your **Year Group**, **Group ID**, and observation details.
3.  Log your observations (e.g., "Robin", Count: 5, Habitat: Forest).
4.  Click **Submit**.
5.  To view your group's data, click **Data** in the navbar and login with your Group ID and Password.

### For Analysis (Lab Work)
1.  Click the **"Eco-Stats Dashboard"** link in the navbar (or open the Streamlit URL).
2.  The dashboard will automatically load the data from the CSV.
3.  View the **Simpson's Index** graphs to see which habitat is more diverse.
4.  Use the charts directly in your lab reports.

### For Admins (Instructors)
1.  Go to `/admin/login` on the Flask app.
2.  **Default Password:** `fieldadmin2026` (Configured in `app.py`).
3.  Use the dashboard to add new student groups or archive old data for the next academic year.

## ☁️ Deployment

This system is ready for cloud deployment (e.g., Render, Railway, Heroku).

*   **Production Server:** Uses `gunicorn` (included in requirements.txt).
*   **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`
*   **Port Handling:** The app is configured to listen to the `$PORT` environment variable automatically.
